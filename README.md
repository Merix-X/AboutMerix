# About Me
## Hi, I’m Merix and I focus on making GUI apps and experimenting with neural networks.
I love coding all sorts of cool apps, mostly in Python and sometimes in C++. In Python. Basically, I just love working with computers and programming! Currently, I’m 14 years old, and I live in the Czech Republic.
More info about me and my projects is on my website!
